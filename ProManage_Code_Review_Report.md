# ProManage Backend Code Review Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed analysis of the ProManage backend codebase. The review focused on identifying areas for improvement in terms of code quality, security, and adherence to best practices.

**Overall Assessment:** The project is well-structured and follows a standard layered architecture. The initial security audit shows a strong security posture in key areas, though several code quality issues require attention.

**Key Findings:**

*   **High Priority:**
    *   [H-001](#H-001): Pervasive use of broad `try-catch (Exception e)` blocks in `NotificationController.java`.
*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   [M-001](#M-001): Use of field injection in `SearchServiceImpl.java`.
    *   [M-002](#M-002): Overly broad exception catching in `AuthController.java`.
*   **Low Priority:**
    *   [L-001](#L-001): Use of `System.out.println` in application code.
*   **Security:**
    *   âœ… **SQL Injection**: No vulnerabilities found. The application correctly uses parameterized queries.
    *   âœ… **Hardcoded Secrets**: No hardcoded secrets found. JWT secrets are correctly externalized and validated at runtime.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### <a name="H-001"></a>ðŸ”´ [H-001] Pervasive Use of Broad `try-catch (Exception e)` Blocks

**Location:** `backend/promanage-api/src/main/java/com/promanage/api/controller/NotificationController.java`

**Issue:** Every public method in `NotificationController.java` is wrapped in a `try-catch (Exception e)` block. This is a major anti-pattern that masks potential bugs, prevents the global exception handler from providing consistent error responses, and can interfere with transactional behavior.

**Recommendation:** Refactor `NotificationController.java` to remove all local `try-catch` blocks. Allow exceptions to propagate to the `GlobalExceptionHandler`, which should be responsible for all exception handling and error response generation.

### <a name="M-001"></a>ðŸŸ  [M-001] Use of Field Injection

**Location:** `backend/promanage-service/src/main/java/com/promanage/service/impl/SearchServiceImpl.java`

**Issue:** `SearchServiceImpl.java` uses `@Autowired` for field injection of its dependencies (`documentMapper`, `projectMapper`, `taskMapper`). The best practice is to use constructor injection, which improves testability and makes dependencies explicit.

**Recommendation:** Refactor `SearchServiceImpl.java` to use constructor injection. This can be easily achieved by adding a constructor that accepts the dependencies as arguments and annotating the class with `@RequiredArgsConstructor` (if using Lombok) or creating the constructor manually.

---

### <a name="M-002"></a>ðŸŸ  [M-002] Overly Broad Exception Catching in `AuthController`

**Location:** `backend/promanage-api/src/main/java/com/promanage/api/controller/AuthController.java`

**Issue:** The `logout()` method in `AuthController.java` catches the generic `Exception`, which can hide the root cause of errors.

**Recommendation:** Refactor the `catch` block to handle more specific exceptions that are expected to be thrown by `tokenBlacklistService.blacklistToken(token)`. Any unexpected runtime exceptions should be allowed to propagate to the global exception handler.

---

### <a name="L-001"></a>ðŸŸ¢ [L-001] Use of `System.out.println` in Application Code

**Location:** Various files, including `ProManageApplication.java`.

**Issue:** `System.out.println` is used for logging in some parts of the application. All logging should be done through a dedicated logging framework (like SLF4J/Logback) to ensure consistent, configurable, and structured logging.

**Recommendation:** Replace all instances of `System.out.println` in the application code with appropriate SLF4J logger calls (e.g., `log.info()`, `log.debug()`, `log.error()`).

## 3. Security Audit

A security audit was conducted to identify common vulnerabilities.

*   **SQL Injection**: **No vulnerabilities found.** The application uses MyBatis with parameterized queries (`#{...}`), which effectively prevents SQL injection attacks. The mapper XML files were reviewed and confirmed to be using safe practices.

*   **Hardcoded Secrets**: **No vulnerabilities found.** The application correctly externalizes sensitive information, such as the JWT secret, using Spring's `@Value("${jwt.secret}")` annotation. The codebase includes a `JwtSecretGenerator` utility and runtime checks in `JwtTokenProvider` to ensure strong secrets are used, which is an excellent security practice.

## 4. Next Steps

The development team should prioritize addressing the findings in this report, starting with the high-priority items. A follow-up review will be conducted to verify that the issues have been resolved.
