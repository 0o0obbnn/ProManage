# ProManage Backend Code Review & Audit Plan

## 1. Introduction & Objectives

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the plan for a comprehensive, professional code review and audit of the ProManage backend system. The review will be conducted with the full context of the project's product, architecture, and engineering documentation to ensure the implementation is not just functionally correct, but also fully aligned with its design principles and quality standards.

### 1.2 Core Objectives
- **Alignment Verification**: Ensure the codebase strictly adheres to the designs laid out in `ProManage_System_Architecture.md` and `ProManage_Technical_Design_Complete.md`.
- **Specification Compliance**: Validate that the API implementation matches the `ProManage_API_Specification.yaml` and that business logic fulfills the requirements in `ProManage_prd.md`.
- **Engineering Standards Adherence**: Audit the code against the detailed guidelines in `ProManage_engineering_spec.md`, including naming conventions, code style, and error handling.
- **Risk Identification**: Proactively identify security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, design flaws, and maintainability issues.
- **Quality Assessment**: Provide a holistic assessment of the code's quality, robustness, and scalability, offering actionable recommendations for improvement.

## 2. Review Scope & Methodology

### 2.1 Scope
The scope of this review encompasses the entire Java backend codebase, structured as a multi-module Maven project. All modules are in scope:
- `promanage-parent` (Parent POM and dependency management)
- `promanage-api` (Controllers, DTOs, and API-level concerns)
- `promanage-service` (Core business logic, entities, and data access)
- `promanage-infrastructure` (Configuration, security, and cross-cutting concerns)
- `promanage-common` (Shared utilities, constants, and exceptions)

### 2.2 Methodology
The audit will be executed in a structured, phased approach, starting from the foundational layers and progressing to the application's business logic. Each phase will be systematically evaluated against a multi-faceted framework:
1.  **Code Quality & Readability**: Adherence to Java standards and project-specific naming conventions.
2.  **Design & Architecture**: Conformance to SOLID principles, microservice boundaries, and documented patterns.
3.  **Java & Spring Best Practices**: Correct use of language features, framework capabilities, and established best practices.
4.  **Performance & Efficiency**: Identification of bottlenecks, inefficient queries, and improper resource management.
5.  **Security**: Analysis of potential vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and compliance with the security architecture.
6.  **Testing & Maintainability**: Evaluation of code testability, test coverage, and long-term extensibility.

## 3. Phased Audit Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration Audit
This phase focuses on the project's backbone, ensuring the foundational setup is sound, secure, and aligned with architectural decisions.

-   **Area**: `promanage-infrastructure`, parent `pom.xml`, `application.yml`.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **Dependency Verification**: Cross-reference all dependencies and versions in `pom.xml` against the `ProManage_System_Architecture.md`. Check for any known critical vulnerabilities in the selected versions (e.g., Spring Boot `3.5.6`, JJWT `0.12.5`, etc.).
    -   [ ] **Database Configuration**: Review Druid connection pool settings for optimal performance. Verify Flyway migration setup is robust.
    -   [ ] **Infrastructure Beans**: Audit the configuration for Redis (`RedisConfig`), Elasticsearch (`ElasticsearchConfig`), RabbitMQ, and MinIO. Ensure connection settings, timeouts, and pooling are configured for production readiness.
    -   [ ] **Security Configuration (`SecurityConfig.java`)**:
        -   Verify JWT validation logic (issuer, audience, expiration).
        -   Confirm endpoint authorization rules match the API specification (e.g., `/auth/**` is public, `/api/**` is authenticated).
        -   Check implementation of CORS, CSRF protection (if applicable), and security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options).
    -   [ ] **Maven Module Structure**: Confirm the module dependencies (`api` depends on `service`, `service` on `dto`, etc.) are logical and enforce the layered architecture.

### Phase 2: Core Domain & Data Access Audit
This phase inspects the heart of the application—the data models and how they are persisted and accessed.

-   **Area**: `promanage-service` (focus on `entity`, `mapper`, `converter` packages).
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **Entity-Relationship Mapping**: Do the `@TableName` annotated entities (`Document`, `User`, `Project`) and their fields accurately reflect the database schema defined in `ProManage_Technical_Design_Complete.md`?
    -   [ ] **MyBatis Plus Mappers**: Review mapper interfaces. Identify overly complex XML/annotated queries that could be simplified or optimized. Look for potential N+1 query issues in service logic.
    -   [ ] **Data Converters (MapStruct)**: Audit all `DocumentConverter`, `UserConverter`, etc. for correct and efficient mapping between Entity, DTO, and VO layers.
    -   [ ] **Enums & Constants**: Verify that status fields and type identifiers use Enums (`UserStatusEnum`) as defined in the engineering spec, and that they are correctly handled in the persistence layer.

### Phase 3: Business Logic & Service Implementation Audit
This is the most critical phase, focusing on the implementation of the core business rules and processes.

-   **Area**: `promanage-service` (focus on `service/impl` packages).
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **Service-Level Transactions**: Is `@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)` applied correctly to service methods that perform writes? Are read-only operations correctly marked with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to leverage performance benefits?
    -   [ ] **Business Logic vs. PRD**: Does the code in services like `ChangeRequestServiceImpl` correctly implement the state machine (`草稿 → 待审批 → ...`) and business rules described in `ProManage_prd.md`?
    -   [ ] **Error Handling**: Is `BusinessException` used appropriately for predictable business errors (e.g., "Document not found")? Is logging sufficient for debugging?
    -   [ ] **Asynchronous Operations & Messaging**: Identify all uses of `@Async` and RabbitMQ event publishing. Do they align with the event-driven architecture for tasks like notification and search indexing? Is the error handling for async processes robust?
    -   [ ] **Cache Implementation**: Review all uses of `@Cacheable` and `@CacheEvict`. Are cache keys specific enough to prevent collisions? Is the cache eviction strategy correct for all update/delete operations to prevent stale data?

### Phase 4: API Layer & Contract Compliance Audit
This phase ensures the public-facing API is a compliant, secure, and user-friendly implementation of the defined contract.

-   **Area**: `promanage-api` (focus on `controller`, `dto` packages).
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **API Endpoint Conformance**: Do `@RestController` paths, HTTP methods, and `@RequestParam`/`@PathVariable` match the `ProManage_API_Specification.yaml` precisely?
    -   [ ] **DTO Validation**: Are request DTOs (`CreateDocumentRequest`) thoroughly annotated with `@Valid` and Jakarta Bean Validation constraints (`@NotBlank`, `@Size`, etc.)? Do response DTOs match the OpenAPI schemas?
    -   [ ] **Security Enforcement**: Is method-level security (`@PreAuthorize`) used to enforce the RBAC policies defined in the architecture documents?
    -   [ ] **Global Exception Handling**: Verify that the `@RestControllerAdvice` correctly intercepts all relevant exceptions and transforms them into the standard API error response format.
    -   [ ] **API Documentation**: Check that `@Operation` and `@Tag` annotations from SpringDoc are used correctly to generate documentation that matches the specification.

### Phase 5: Common Utilities & Cross-Cutting Concerns Audit
This final phase reviews the shared code to ensure it is efficient, reusable, and free of issues that could affect the entire application.

-   **Area**: `promanage-common`.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **Utility Classes**: Review all helper classes for correctness, efficiency, and null-safety. Ensure they have high unit test coverage.
    -   [ ] **Constants**: Confirm that magic strings and numbers are centralized in constant classes as per the engineering spec.
    -   [ ] **Domain Objects**: Ensure the global `Result` and `PageResult` objects are used consistently across all controller endpoints to provide a uniform API experience.

## 4. Deliverables

The primary deliverable will be a single, comprehensive **Code Review Report** in Markdown format. This report will:
-   Begin with a high-level summary and overall assessment.
-   Detail strengths and areas of excellence.
-   Enumerate all findings, categorized by severity (Critical, Important, Minor).
-   For each finding, provide a clear explanation, cite the relevant project documentation, show the problematic code, and suggest a concrete fix.
-   Conclude with a prioritized list of actionable recommendations.

## 5. Next Steps

This comprehensive review is a multi-stage effort. I will now begin with **Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration Audit**. Upon its completion, I will share the initial findings before proceeding to the subsequent phases.
