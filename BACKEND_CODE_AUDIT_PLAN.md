# ProManage Backend Code Audit Plan

## 1. Context & References

- **Product Vision & KPIs**: `ProManage_prd.md`
- **API Contract**: `ProManage_API_Specification.yaml`
- **System Architecture Baseline**: `ProManage_System_Architecture.md`
- **Engineering Practices & Coding Standards**: `ProManage_engineering_spec.md`
- **Technical Design Blueprint**: `ProManage_Technical_Design_Complete.md`

The audit will benchmark the implemented backend against the target state defined in the documents above and highlight deviations, risks, and remediation priorities.

## 2. Audit Objectives

1. **Architecture Alignment** – verify that deployed modules, integrations, and infrastructure choices conform to the approved architecture and microservice boundaries.
2. **Functional Conformance** – ensure API behaviours, data flows, and business rules comply with the PRD and OpenAPI specification.
3. **Code Quality & Maintainability** – assess adherence to engineering standards, readability, modularity, and presence of technical debt.
4. **Security & Compliance** – evaluate authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure coding practices against the specified security model.
5. **Performance & Resilience** – validate caching strategy, database usage, asynchronous processing, and readiness for KPI targets (P95 ≤ 300 ms, 500+ concurrent users).
6. **Data Integrity & Migration** – review schema design, migration scripts, multi-tenancy controls, and data lifecycle management.
7. **Testing & DevOps Practice** – confirm automated testing coverage, CI/CD gates, observability, and incident readiness.

## 3. Audit Scope

| Layer | Scope Items |
| --- | --- |
| **Architecture & Deployment** | Module boundaries, dependency graphs, configuration profiles, environment parity, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts |
| **Codebase** | Controllers, services, repositories/mappers, cross-cutting utilities, DTOs, exception handling, logging |
| **APIs** | Request/response schemas, validation, pagination, error contracts, backward compatibility |
| **Security** | JWT issuance/validation, RBAC/ABAC, method-level guards, data masking, secret management, rate limiting |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL schema, indexes, constraints, soft-delete strategy, Flyway scripts, Redis usage, Elasticsearch documents |
| **Integration** | RabbitMQ message flows, MinIO/S3 interactions, third-party touchpoints |
| **Quality Pipeline** | Unit/integration tests, coverage reports, Sonar/Checkstyle outputs, Git workflow compliance |
| **Observability** | Actuator exposure, Prometheus metrics, logging configuration, alert rules |

## 4. Audit Methodology & Phases

1. **Preparation & Intake (Day 0–1)**
   - Confirm code baseline/branch (`backend-todos-tags-analytics-import`).
   - Inventory services, modules, and environment configs.
   - Gather existing runbooks, CI pipelines, recent defect lists.

2. **Static Analysis (Day 2–4)**
   - Run automated scanners (SonarQube, Checkstyle, PMD) per engineering spec.
   - Evaluate package structure, dependency hygiene, layering violations.
   - Manual review of representative controllers/services/entities focusing on document, task, change-request, and security flows.

3. **API Contract Verification (Day 5)**
   - Diff implemented endpoints against OpenAPI spec.
   - Validate request/response samples, error codes, pagination semantics.
   - Check Swagger annotations completeness and versioning strategy.

4. **Security Review (Day 6–7)**
   - Inspect authentication pipeline (JWT generation, blacklist, refresh flows).
   - Verify `@PreAuthorize`/`@RequirePermission` usage, permission evaluator, and method-level enforcement.
   - Assess input validation, SQL injection safeguards, XSS handling, sensitive data encryption, rate limiting, replay protection.

5. **Data & Migration Assessment (Day 8)**
   - Compare schema to design targets; review indexing, partitioning, and soft delete implementation.
   - Audit Flyway scripts (naming, idempotency, rollback readiness).
   - Validate Redis key strategy, TTLs, and cache invalidation.

6. **Performance & Resilience Review (Day 9)**
   - Analyse caching layers (Spring Cache, Redis) and asynchronous jobs.
   - Review heavy queries, batching, transaction scopes, and circuit breakers.
   - Inspect Prometheus metrics, alert thresholds, gateway timeouts.

7. **Testing & DevOps Evaluation (Day 10)**
   - Check unit/integration test coverage, naming conventions, Testcontainers usage.
   - Review CI/CD pipelines, quality gates, build artefacts, Dockerfiles, Helm charts.
   - Validate rollback procedures, runbooks, and incident response readiness.

8. **Synthesis & Reporting (Day 11–12)**
   - Consolidate findings by severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Improvement).
   - Map gaps to remediation actions, owners, and suggested timelines.
   - Deliver executive summary plus detailed appendix.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

| Dimension | Key Checks | Success Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture Alignment | Service boundaries, dependency rules, configuration per profile | Matches technical design; deviations documented |
| Code Quality | SOLID adherence, duplication, complexity, logging | SonarQube ≥ 80% coverage, complexity ≤ 10, clean logs |
| Security | AuthN/AuthZ flow, input sanitisation, secrets management | No critical OWASP Top-10 gaps, centralised secrets |
| Performance | Caching efficacy, query plans, async processing | Meets KPI budgets under representative load |
| Data | Schema consistency, migration traceability, multi-tenancy guardrails | Flyway history consistent; tenant isolation enforced |
| Reliability | Observability, alerts, failure handling, retry policies | Alert rules active, graceful degradation in place |
| Process | CI/CD gates, branch hygiene, documentation | Pipelines enforce tests & lint; Git workflow followed |

## 6. Deliverables

- **Audit Report (PDF/MD)** – executive summary, risk matrix, and detailed findings.
- **Remediation Backlog** – prioritised action items with effort estimates and dependency notes.
- **Compliance Matrix** – traceability from requirements (PRD/API/Design) to implemented features and identified deviations.
- **Review Workshop** – walkthrough session with backend, QA, DevOps, and security stakeholders.

## 7. Timeline & Milestones (Indicative)

| Day | Activity | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Kick-off, asset collection | Agenda, artefact list |
| 1–4 | Static review & tooling runs | Preliminary findings log |
| 5 | API conformance tests | Endpoint gap checklist |
| 6–7 | Security assessment | Security risk register |
| 8 | Data & migration review | Schema compliance notes |
| 9 | Performance/resilience review | Performance observations |
| 10 | Testing & DevOps review | Pipeline assessment |
| 11–12 | Reporting & validation | Final report + remediation backlog |

Actual scheduling will align with team availability and release cadence; compressions possible with parallel reviewers.

## 8. Stakeholders & Responsibilities

- **Audit Lead (Backend)** – coordinate activities, synthesize findings.
- **Module Owners (Documents, Tasks, Change Requests, Security)** – provide walkthroughs and remediation plans.
- **DevOps/Platform Team** – supply deployment manifests, monitoring dashboards, incident history.
- **QA Lead** – share coverage metrics, automated suites, defect trends.
- **Product & Architecture** – validate requirement alignment and accept remediation priorities.

## 9. Required Artefacts & Tooling

- Source repositories, branch policies, and commit history.

## 10. Success Metrics

- Zero critical security or compliance gaps remaining open post-audit action plan.
- Documented remediation backlog with ownership and timelines agreed.
- Executive endorsement of audit findings and integration into release roadmap.
- Establishment (or confirmation) of continuous quality gates matching engineering spec.
